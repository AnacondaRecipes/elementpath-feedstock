  summary: XPath 1.0/2.0 parsers and selectors for ElementTree
  description: |
      The proposal of this package is to provide XPath 1.0 and 2.0 selectors
      for Python’s ElementTree XML data structures, both for the standard
      ElementTree library and for the lxml.etree library.

      For lxml.etree this package could be useful for providing XPath 2.0
      selectors, because lxml.etree already has it’s own implementation of
      XPath 1.0.

      The XPath 2.0 functions implementation is partial, due to wide number of
      functions that this language provides.
